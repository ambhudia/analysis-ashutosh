    Fixing the hdf5 > netcdf conversion issue
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        $ cd
        $ rm -rf .local
        $ cd $PROJECT/$USER/MIDOSS/
        $ pip3 install --user -e moad_tools
        $ hdf5-to-netcdf4 --help
        $ pip install --user -e NEMO-Cmd/
        $ pip install --user -e MOHID-Cmd/

    Setting up to make multiple runs at SoG point
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        From Rachael's spreadsheet document, I have set my script to generate the hdf5 input files over five different time ranges.
        The conversion is being done on hake.

        On Cedar
        ^^^^^^^^
        Created runs config directory: /home/abhudia/project/abhudia/MIDOSS/MIDOSS-MOHID-config/MF0

        This directory contains:
        settings: frequently used .dat files that do not change
                Atmosphere.dat    InterfaceSedimentWater.dat              Tide.dat
                Geometry.dat      InterfaceWaterAir.dat                   Turbulence.dat
                Hydrodynamic.dat  ST_georgia_bathymetry_modified_v02.dat  WaterProperties.dat
        folders with run IDS that have input hdf5 files, .yaml, Lagranigan.dat, Model.dat and Waves.dat
                .yaml file header gives job name and allocates resources to job. contains the locations of all the dat files and instructions on creating symlinks in the runs dir.
                Lagrangian.dat used primarily to chnage location of Oil spill. This has been updated with the Medium Floater attributes from the oil types spreadsheet.
                Model.dat used to set the time period over which we want MOHID to run
                Waves.dat will contain the required information on how to deal with waves depending on whether or not we have the ww3.hdf5 file for a run

        What changes from job to job
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        1) .yaml: the job ID in the header, wall time depending on how long we are running + how many input parameters we have
        2) Model.dat: the model run duration
        3) Waves.dat: depending on whether or not we have wave watch input data
        4) Lagrangian.dat: the oil spill location/oil type

    Making test run
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        A test run was made on cedar with all the forcing parameters and a reduced model run time. Successful.
        Wave file was output in the res directory. This was fixed by making the hdf5 out 0 in the Waves.dat file

6 March 2019
^^^^^^^^^^^^
    Setting up to make multiple runs at the Strait of Georgia point
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        1) To get a feel of how long a job is likely to take, I have set the SOG12117 case to run for the full duration of the input files on a wall time of 1:50:00
            
            [abhudia@cedar1 ~]$ cd project/abhudia/MIDOSS/MIDOSS-MOHID-config/MF0/SOG12117/
            [abhudia@cedar1 SOG12117]$ mohid run SOG12117.yaml $PROJECT/$USER/MIDOSS/results/MF0/SOG12117

        ConstructHDFPredictDTMethod1 - ModuleFillMatrix - ERR50
        Could not read solution from HDF5 file
        Last instant in file lower than simulation ending time
        Matrix name: wind velocity X
        
        Shihan sent over new bathymetry file. I am switching to that one for this initial run.




        2) In the meantime, I am copying over the other job files to Cedar and making the required chnages to each job's YAML file and .dat files.
                SOG060515_7 : set model.dat date range
                Set current run attributes in YAML file and pointed to Waves.dat in settings since no ww3 data
            STDOUT: 
                THE RUN JUST ENDED: NOTE YOU NEED TO RE RUN AFTER INPUTTING NEW BATHYMETRY 
                A new Bathymetry has been created, which consists with the geometry

            Modify the file Nomfich.dat and Re-run the model
            New Bathymetry file :

            .dat


            Found that wave watch dates are wrong, so those will need to be Corrected
            In the meantime, start other run that does not use wave watch 
                mohid run SOG060515_7.yaml $PROJECT/$USER/MIDOSS/results/MF0/SOG060515_7


        3) I am also getting the turn point input files going on Salish

7 March 2019
^^^^^^^^^^^^
    Made an interactive run statting just before MOHID was crashing 1) without waves file 2) with shorter directory. Both crashed with same Error.     
    Taked to Shihan, who said I should also update Geometry.dat, which he provided. Old Geometry.dat saved as Geometry.old
    Ran interactively using same config as 1) above but with new Geometry.dat, and the run did not crash. This was confirmed by looking at the time stamps in ncdump.
    I shall now reconfigure the Model.dat to make a full run, with the wave watch data as well.

    - New naming convention also introduced:

        location_date_oiltype_oilvolume_ndays

        e.g. SOGa_05june2015_LE0_1000m3_7days, with:

        1) SOGa: is the location we have currently chosen for SOG.  We may choose another (several?) prior to doing the stochastic runs, hence, the “a”.
        2) 05june2015: represents the start-date of the run
        3) LE0: represents that oil type.  In this case, it’s Light Evaporate “0”, where “0” is an index for the kind of LE that we are running
        4) 1000m3: Oil volume
        5) 7days: Run length


    - Will have to read through MOHID documentation and find out how best ot make the bathymetry.dat file

8 March 2019
^^^^^^^^^^^^
    Developed further visualisation for oil spill thickness. Will adapt the functions to do the same for 3D concentrations.
    Developed notebook to extract tidal records from hdf5.

    We decided to start runs at low tide and make a second run for the scenario 6 hours after that.

    Cedar:
    ^^^^^^
        $ cd /home/abhudia/project/abhudia/MIDOSS/MIDOSS-MOHID-config/MF0/SOG12117
        
        Prep runs:
            Made new .yaml and Model.dat files for the runs. the yaml files contain thr run ID and point to the correct Model.dat file
            Model_low.dat has the start time at low tide
            Model_hi.dat has the start time six hours later

        Make runs: 
            $ mohid run SOGa_01dec17_MF0_1000m3_7days_low.yaml $PROJECT/abhudia/MIDOSS/results/MF0/SOGa_01dec17_MF0_1000m3_7days_low
            $ mohid run SOGa_01dec17_MF0_1000m3_7days_hi.yaml $PROJECT/abhudia/MIDOSS/results/MF0/SOGa_01dec17_MF0_1000m3_7days_hi

            Note: mohid run is taking a few minutes to submit the run today
    
        Got the following error for the first attempt at making the run:

        ^^^^^^^^^
            Due to file system error on cedar, these commands will have to be run later:

            UPDATE: Both runs submitted

            In the meantime, I am prepping the other runs. The commands that follow will be to set off the runs that I have ready.

        Salmon Bank Runs:
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
            Set Salish to generate the input files
            Prepped the following for a run: /results2/MIDOSS/forcing/SalishSeaCast/MF0/SB080117_7
            For this one, the high tide prior to the ebb was used for the second run since the forcing files began at a weird cutoff
                $ cd /home/abhudia/project/abhudia/MIDOSS/MIDOSS-MOHID-config/MF0/SB080117_7

        the initial SoG runs ran out of wall time so I restarted them with 2:30:00 of wall time up from 1:40:00
